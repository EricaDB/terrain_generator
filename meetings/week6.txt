Week 6 meeting 2/13/15

Attendants: 
   Erica Johnson, Sage Berg, Nathan Pointer

Summary:
    - Delegated tasks to complete/work on before next meeting.
        - Nathan will work on creating the program that turns our map into
          HTML so we can start viewing our program.
	- Sage will work on the terrain_generator algorithm for generating 
	  realistic terrain maps (right now it generates random ones)
	- Erica will work on a new generator and generator algorithm, such
	  as a cave or dungeon generator.
    - Discussed putting objects instead of characters in the maps we generate
      later on in the project so they can have attributes such as altitude or 
      they can be city objects.
    - Spent time coding together.
    - Sage discussed terrain generation algorithm strategy.

Approximate duration: slightly over an hour
