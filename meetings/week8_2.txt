Week 8 meeting 2 2/28/15

Attendants: 
   Erica Johnson, Sage Berg, Nathan Pointer

Summary:
    - Discussed what we will each work on before next meeting.
        - Nathan will continue work on the Node.js plugin for visualizing our 
          generated maps. Also an alternate format for JSON.
	- Sage will continue work on smoothing out the terrain_generator algorithm for
          generating realistic terrain maps. Also, will work on a diamond squares 
          algorithm terrain_generator with the tile objects.
	- Erica will work on the cave_generator more, maybe adding in gem tiles with
          the rock and air tiles. Also will work more on the tile object class.
    - Discussed a mouse-over aspect to include in the final project where you can mouse
      over parts of the map to see more information about the map (like the type of tile).

Approximate duration: ~ 20 - 30 min
