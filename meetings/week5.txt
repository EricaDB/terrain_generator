Week 5 meeting 2/6/15

Attendants: 
   Erica Johnson, Sage Berg, Nathan Pointer

Summary:
    - First meeting, discussed creating the project iteratively (meaning 
      we always have a working full project but build it up over time, etc.)
    - Task delegation (Erica makes the repo, Sage and Erica will work on a 
      starting version of generator files, Nathan will work on creating view 
      programs, etc.)

Approximate duration: ~ 20 - 30 min.
