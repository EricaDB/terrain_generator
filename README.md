Project title: Terrain Generator

Team members: Erica Johnson, Sage Berg, Nathan Pointer

Project Description: A procedural terrain generator that will take parameters such as size as input and visually render that to a web page. Our goal for any map type is for it to make sense, i.e., no lava next to ocean tiles. HTML is being used as a way to implement visual representation.

Goals:

*Generate an array of characters that represents a map with different types of terrain on it.

*Visualize the array in html.

*Allow user input to influence the type of map generated.

*Host the program on the internet (if time permits).
